Welcome to the CollaboRhythm Project.

You need the code in this repository to start developing Mobile or desktop applications for CollaboRhythm!

Setting up your development environment:
These instructions have been tested on Mac OSX and Windows 7. They should work on other versions of those same operating systems. Unfortunately they will not work on linux as Adobe has discontinued support for its core build tools on linux.

Currently these projects leverage a number of Adobe Air features and as such rely on Adobe Lab's Flash Builder (the Burrito release). You can probably use any SDE that you like but we recommend Eclipse. As far as adding Git support, as per this quora thread: http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-Eclipse-plugin-to-manage-git, there are a number of options including EGit, Aptana, or installing an OS level Git manager rather than using it directly from Eclipse.

Download and install:
1. Adobe Lab's Flash Builder (Release "Burrito"): https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=labs_flashbuilder_burrito
2. Install egit (git plugin): http://www.eclipse.org/egit/ (or another way of connecting to a git repo) - see below for detailed instructions

Sync the Source Code:
1. The normal git thing: git init, then grab the repository from the above URL (ie the "read-only" URL)
2. Also we encourage you to fork the code and make your own changes as well as "pull" requests when appropriate.

Getting Started:
1. Open Flash Builder Burrito.
2. Open the Git Repositories perspective.
3. Click the button in the toolbar to “Clone Git Repository”
4. Enter the URI: https://github.com/newmediamedicine/CollaboRhythm.git
5. Click Next.
6. For branch selection, “master” should be checked. Click Next to continue.
7. Change the local path for your repository to an appropriate location. I added a folder called “Git Repositories” and used the following path: C:\Users\sgilroy\Git Repositories\CollaboRhythm
8. Click OK.
9. Right-click on the CollaboRhythm repository (the root node) and select “Import Projects…”
10. “Working directory” should be selected. Click Next to continue.
11. Click Select All.
12. Click the checkbox “Add project to working sets”.
13. Click Select…
14. Click New…
15. Select Resource
16. Click Next
17. Specify “CollaboRhythm”
18. Click Finish
19. Click OK to close the Select Working Sets window.
20. Click Finish
21. Switch to the Flash perspective
22. Open CollaboRhythm.Mobile -> src -> (default package) -> CollaboRhythmMobileApplication.mxml
23. Click Run -> Run As -> Mobile Application
24. Select On desktop
25. Select your device (probably Samsung Vibrant; or you can choose something different from your actual hardware)
26. Click Run
27. The simulator should run and show you the mobile application (currently a big clock).

Additional Notes on Installing EGit:
These instructions are specifically for Windows 7
1. If Flash Builder Burrito is running, exit it.
2. Right-click on Flash Builder Burrito and chose “Run as administrator”. If you don’t run as administrator you may have problems installing the plugin successfully.
3. Click Help -> Install New Software…
4. Under “Work with:” you may see “http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates”. If so, proceed to step 10.
5. Click on the link “Available Software Sites” to open the Preferences window to the appropriate page.
6. Enter “http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates” in filter text box.
7. If no entries are listed, click Add and enter “EGit”, “http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates” and proceed to step 9.
8. Otherwise, click on the blank name cell and rename the entry to “EGit”.
9. Click on the Enable button.
10. Click OK to close Preferences.
11. Under “Work with:” select “http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates”
12. Expand the entry “Eclipse Git Team Provider (Incubation)” (do NOT check this item).
13. Check the box next to “Eclipse EGit (Incubation)”.
14. Click Next.
15. Click Next again.
16. Click on the “I accept” radio button.
17. Click Finish.
18. Wait for installation to complete.
19. Click Restart Now to restart Eclipse.
20. When Eclipse (Flash Builder Burrito) re-opens, click Window -> Open Perspective -> Other…
21. Select Git Repository Exploring.
22. Click OK.
23. EGit is now installed and ready to be used.

You may run into an error that says:
